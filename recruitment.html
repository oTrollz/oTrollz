<p>Whether you are new to our community and want to make a difference, or a long time resident who understands how Cedar Grove has relied on its volunteers for decades, please consider joining the Cedar Grove Ambulance and Rescue Squad. Joining our group of dedicated volunteers and serving as an EMT or Ambulance Driver allows one to experience what itâ€™s like to make a positive impact on the lives of friends and neighbors in their time of need. Our recent recruitment letter explained the challenges we are facing and referenced a few issues that have arisen in areas of NJ where volunteer EMS has ceased to exist. We are indebted to the town council for their choice to support us as we rebuild and retrain, so that the best possible volunteer emergency medical service can be delivered to our residents. Township administration has supported us throughout this journey and made necessary accommodations in delivery of EMS services as we reorganized, all with the best interest of the residents in mind at every turn. Without their support, we would not be in a position to serve our community as the volunteer organization we strive to be. We look forward to continue working with the council to take positive steps that best serve the community.</p>
