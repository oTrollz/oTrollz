    <summary>How to Recognize a Stroke — Every Second Counts</summary>
    <p>When it comes to stroke, time is brain. Every minute that passes without treatment, nearly 2 million brain cells can die. Recognizing the signs early and calling 911 immediately can save a life and prevent long-term disability.</p>
    <p><strong>What is a Stroke?</strong> A stroke happens when blood flow to part of the brain is blocked (ischemic stroke) or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts (hemorrhagic stroke). Without blood and oxygen, brain cells begin to die rapidly.</p>
    <p><strong>The FAST Test</strong><br>F — Face: Ask the person to smile. Does one side droop?<br>A — Arms: Ask them to raise both arms. Does one drift downward?<br>S — Speech: Ask them to repeat a simple phrase. Is their speech slurred or strange?<br>T — Time: If you notice any of these signs, call 911 immediately.</p>
    <p>Additional Warning Signs include sudden confusion or trouble understanding speech, sudden numbness or weakness in the face, arm, or leg, sudden trouble seeing, sudden dizziness or loss of balance, and a sudden severe headache with no known cause.</p>
    <p>If you suspect a stroke, call 911 right away, note the time symptoms began, and stay with the person until help arrives. Acting fast can greatly improve outcomes.</p>

    <summary>How to Recognize a Heart Attack — The Signs You Should Never Ignore</summary>
    <p>Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, but quick recognition and action can make all the difference. Many people delay calling 911 because they are unsure if what they’re feeling is “really” a heart attack.</p>
    <p><strong>What is a Heart Attack?</strong> A heart attack happens when blood flow to the heart muscle is blocked, usually by a clot in the coronary arteries. Without oxygen-rich blood, part of the heart muscle begins to die.</p>
    <p><strong>Common Warning Signs</strong> include chest discomfort, upper body discomfort, shortness of breath, and cold sweats, nausea, or lightheadedness.</p>
    <p><strong>Women and Heart Attack Symptoms</strong> may include nausea or vomiting, unusual fatigue, shortness of breath, and pain in the jaw, neck, or back.</p>
    <p>If you suspect a heart attack, call 911 immediately, stay calm, chew aspirin if instructed, and follow dispatcher instructions. Quick action saves lives.</p>
